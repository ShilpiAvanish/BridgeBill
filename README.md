#  BridgeBill

BridgeBill is a web application designed to simplify medical bill management. Users can upload their medical bills to extract CPT codes, view descriptions of charges, verify if costs are within the expected price range, and generate pre-written emails to query healthcare providers about potential overcharges. This project was recognized with second place at a start-up competition for its innovative approach to enhancing healthcare billing transparency.
